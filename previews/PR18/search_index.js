(2010)\n\nRequires:\n\na user-specified maximum cluster size\nan elimination order for the nodes in the HybridNetwork, hopefully yielding a small induced-width, e.g. from a heuristic such as greedy min-fill (see triangulate_minfill!(graph)).\n\nEach node in net labels a \"bucket\", and these buckets are ordered according to the elimination order, e.g. the highest-priority bucket is labelled by the first node in the elimination order.\nNode families are assigned to buckets based on the highest-priority node they contain. For example, if {1,4,9} forms a node family and if node 4 is higher in the elimination order than nodes 1 or 9, then {1,4,9} gets assigned to bucket 4.\nNode families are clusters (of nodes), and we refer to the clusters within a bucket as \"minibuckets\". Minibuckets within a bucket can be merged as long as the size of their union does not exceed the maximum cluster size allowed. Sometimes, this can be done in multiple ways.\nStarting with the highest-priority bucket, we create new minibuckets by \"marginalizing out\" the bucket label from each existing minibucket (these are left unchanged in the process).\nEach new minibucket is joined to its \"originator\" minibucket by an edge that is labeled by their intersection (i.e. the variables in the new minibucket). Each new minibucket is then reassigned to a new (and necessarily lower-priority) bucket based on its highest priority node. Merging can take place during reassignment as long as the the maximum cluster size is respected. The union of 2 minibuckets retains the edges of each of minibucket.\nSteps 4 & 5 are carried out for each bucket in order of priority.\nThe resulting minibuckets in each bucket are then joined in a chain (there is some degree of freedom for how this can be done), where each edge is labelled by the bucket label.\n\nReferences\n\nR.

An edge (C1,C2) is added if clusters C1 and C2 share at least 1 node (in net). The weight of edge (C1,C2) is defined as the size of the intersection C1 ∩ C2.\nFor each node n in net, the subgraph of G induced by the clusters containing n, G_n, has its weights adjusted as follows:\nthe edges of maximum weight (within G_n) are identified, then\nthe weight of each edge is increased by the number of max-weight edges that either of its endpoints adjacent to.\nThen, LTRIP finds a maximum-weight spanning tree of G_n. The edges of this tree are all labelled with {n} (or its label or preorder index).\nThe spanning trees for each node are layered on one another to form a cluster graph. In other words, an edge (C1,C2) is added if it is present is any spanning tree. If so, its sepset is the union of its labels across the different spanning trees.\n\nReferences\n\nS.
